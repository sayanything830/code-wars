## Indexed Capitalization

This challenge passed in two arguments, one string with letters and one array with numbers. The goal was to convert the letter index in the string that corresponded to the number in the array into upper case.

This challenge was relatively easy compared to some in the past week.

> Given a string and an array of integers representing indices, capitalize all letters at the given indices.
