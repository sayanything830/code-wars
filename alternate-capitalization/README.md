## Alternate Capitalization

This challenged involved creating code that would take a string and change all even indexes to capital letters. Then do the same with all odd number indexes.

> Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.

> For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.

> The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.

> Good luck!

Note: in my altLower function, I attempted to set s to lower case:

 `lower += s[i].toLowerCase`

but this broke my code and I'm not entirely sure why.
