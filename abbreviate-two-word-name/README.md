## Abbreviate a Two Word Name

Lab Partner - Kevin Miller

In this assignment, our goal was to write code into a function that would take an argument containing two names and return the first initial of each name joined by a period.

> Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.

> The output should be two capital letters with a dot seperating them.

> It should look like this:

> Sam Harris => S.H

> Patrick Feeney => P.F
