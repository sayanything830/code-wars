## Format Words into a sentence

This challenge involved taking an array of seperate strings, removing empty strings, and returning one string with each item separated by a comma and include 'and' between the last two words. If the array is empty, return and empty string, if the array has one word, return that one word, if the array has two words, only return the words with 'and' between, no commas.

> Complete the method so that it formats the words into a single comma separated value. The last word should be separated by the word 'and' instead of a comma. The method takes in an array of strings and returns a single formatted string. Empty string values should be ignored. Empty arrays or null/nil values being passed into the method should result in an empty string being returned.
