## Disemvowel Trolls

This challenge is to take a string, remove all its vowels, and returning the updated string back through a function. Since regex finds matches, I created a regex to look for vowels within a .replace method used for strings.

> Trolls are attacking your comment section!

> A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

> Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

> For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

> Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
