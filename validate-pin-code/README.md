## Validate Pin Code

This challenge was to take a string and turn every other character into upper case, (ex: AbCdEf), then do the same with every other character into lower case, (ex: aBcDeF).

> ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

> If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.
