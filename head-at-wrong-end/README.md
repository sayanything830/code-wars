## My Head is at the Wrong End

This problem would like us to take an array and reverse the values of the indexes, ex: [1,2,3] becomes [3,2,1].

> You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!

> Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).

> Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics - simples!

This solution was a pretty quick one, my partner and I discussed the use of the .reverse method for arrays, plugged it into the function and it worked!
