## Nice Array

The goal with this kata is to create a function that checks each element (n) in an array to see if there is another element within the array that's value is either + 1 (n+1), or - 1 (n-1). The tests also include empty arrays which ended up being my challenge to include that conditional statement in the correct place in my code.

> A Nice array is defined to be an array where for every value n in the array, there is also an element n-1 or n+1 in the array.
