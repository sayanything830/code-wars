## Insert Dashes

The goal of this assignment was to create a function that takes in a number as an argument and inserts a dash between two odd numbers.

> Write a function insertDash(num)/InsertDash(int num) that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number.

This was much harder than the previous Code War challenges since it involved some syntax I was not familiar with (specifically the remainder assignment/modulo %. I had to seek help from classmates and Google to come up with a solution that passed the code wars test. Though I did not come up with this code entirely on my own, I fully understand how and why it works.

Other solutions shown in code wars as best practice used regular expressions and the .replace() prototype method of the String function (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace), again more syntax I was not familiar with, but after some research, can understand how and why it works.
